#' generate_excess_mortality_tau
#'
#' a function that takes as arguments age,time and tau - which indicates the average time since infection among the infected population - and returns a numeric vector of length equivelent to the number of times indicated by the simulation
#' representing a rate of excess mortality -i.e. among infected population relative to non-infected population - at the indicated age and time
#' The generate_mortality function is required as an argument for the package's do_simulation function
#' The function may be user defined and stored as an R object. Otherwise a default value - entered as "default" - is provided by the package
#' @param t numeric, indicates time or times at which the excess mortality rate is desired
#' @param ta numeric, indicates average time since infection among the infected poplation
#' @param constant numeric, indicates a constant rate of excess mortality
#' @param age_min numeric, indicates minimum age to be included in the simulation
#' @param age_max numeric, indicates maximum age to be included in the simulation
#' @param exmin numeric, indicates minimum excess mortality, which is at age_min
#' @param exfin numeric, indicates maximum/final excess mortality at age_max, unless otherwise specified by user defined function
#' @return a numeric vector that represents the excess mortality rate at age and time.
