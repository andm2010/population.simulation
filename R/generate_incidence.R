#' a function that takes as arguments age and time and returns a numeric vector of length 1
#' representing a rate of incidence at the indicated age and time
#' The generate_incidence function is required as an argument for the do_simulation function
#' The function may be user defined and stored as an R object. Otherwise a default value - entered as "default" - is provided by the package
#' @param t numeric, indicates time or times at which the incidence rate is desired
#' @param constant numeric, indicates a constant rate of incidence
#' @param age_min numeric, indicates minimum age to be included in the simulation
#' @param age_max numeric, indicates maximum age to be included in the simulation
#' @param age_peak numberic, indicates age at which indicence reaches maximum, which is at \code{Ipeak}
#' @param Imin numeric, indicates minimum incidence, which is at \code{age_min}
#' @param Ipeak numeric, indicates maximum incidence at \code{Ipeak}
#' @param Ifin numeric, indicates incidence at \code{Ipeak}
#' @return a numeric vector that represents the incidence rate at \code{t}.
