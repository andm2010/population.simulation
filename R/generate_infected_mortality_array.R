#' a function that returns a matrix of probabilities of mortality for each age and time step of the simulation
#' @usage #' @usage \code{generate_infected_mortality_array} (\code{age_steps},\code{birth_dates},\code{generate_excess_mortality_tau_fun}, \code{generate_base_mortality_fun})
#' @param age_steps a number. Indicates the number of steps forward each age group will be aged in the simulation by \code{do_sim}
#' @param birth_dates a numeric vector of length min:max; indicates the range of ages to be included in simulation. Note that date format is not used.
#' @param generate_base_mortality_fun a function which takes as arguments age and time and returns a numberic rate of mortality for each age and time included in the simulation.
#' This function can be defined by user or can be selected from among several default options included in the package.
#' The user-defined or package default function should be called by name when included as an argument in the \code{generate_base_mortality_matrix} function.
#' @param generate_excess_mortality_tau_fun a function which takes as arguments age, time and tau - i.e. the time since infection among the infected population - and returns a numberic rate of mortality for each age and time included in the simulation
#' This function can be defined by user or can be selected from among several default options included in the package.
#' The user-defined or package default function should be called by name when included as an argument in the \code{generate_base_mortality_matrix} function.
#' @return returns an array of dimensions time, age and time since infection
