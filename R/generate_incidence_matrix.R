#' a function that returns a matrix of probabilities for each age and time step of the simulation
#' @usage \code{generate_incidence_matrix} (\code{age_steps},\code{birth_dates},\code{generate_incidence_fun})
#' @param age_steps numeric vector of length 1. Indicates the number of steps forward each age group will be aged in the simulation by \code{do_sim}
#' @param birth_dates a numeric vectors of length min:max; indicates the range of ages to be included in simulation. Note that date format is not used.
#' @param generate_incidence a function which takes as arguments age and time and returns a numberic rate of incidence for each age and time included in the simulation.
#' This function can be defined by user or can be selected from among several default options included in the package.
#' The user-defined or package default function should be called by name when included as an argument in the \code{generate_incidence_matrix} function.
#' @return a matrix of column length \code{age_steps} and row length \code{birth_dates}.
#' Values stored in the matrix are numeric double, from 0-1, which represent the probability of becoming infected at \code{t} and \code{age_steps}
#' @examples y <- generate_incidence_matrix (age_steps = 2, birth_dates = 10:15, generate_incidence)
